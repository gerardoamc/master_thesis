Thank you Prof. Osswald and Prof. Rudolph for your trust and patience. I couldn't hope for better advisors.
     
Thank you Tom for your extrusion expertise. I suppose the sass was OK too.

Thank you Luke for building the tools necessary for this whole project to work. And for answering all my random grammar questions.

Thank you Alec for being an ever-present helping hand, sounding board, and a great classmate. Hope you make ND proud.

Thank you to Thibaut, Colby and Brendan. The content of this thesis would be very different without your contributions.
    
Thank you to the entire PEC family for creating a great learning and research environment.
