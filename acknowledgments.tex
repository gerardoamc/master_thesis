Thank you Prof. Osswald and Prof. Rudolph for your trust and patience. I couldn't hope for better advisors.
     
Thank you Tom for your extrusion expertise and polymer knowledge. I suppose the sass was OK too.

Thank you Luke for building the tools necessary for this whole project to work. And for answering all my random grammar questions.

Thank you Alec for being an ever-present helping hand, sounding board, and a great classmate. Hope you make ND proud.

Thank you to Thibaut, Colby and Brendan. This thesis would look like very different without your contributions.
    
Thank you to the entire PEC family for creating a great learning environment. I've grown so much with all of you. I hope that you've learned a thing or two with me as well.

Thank you to Ben, Josh, Diego, Iv\'an and Jos\'e for your friendship. Madison is an amazing city but you made it a lot more fun. I wish you the best, wherever your future leads you.

Gracias a mi familia, a quienes les debo todo.

Gracias Sonya por tu cari\~no, por tus consejos y por tu madurez. Te quiero.
