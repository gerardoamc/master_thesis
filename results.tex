\chapter{Results} \label{ch:res}

This chapter presents all the results stemming from the experimental procedures described in Chapter \ref{ch:exp}. Additionally, details are provided regarding proper data processing, and the calculations that lead to the definition of the desired failure surface. 

\section{Tensile Tests} \label{sec:tensr}
Performing tensile tests showed that the values of $X_t$ and $Y_t$ were significantly different, in accordance to the literature review presented in Section \ref{ssec:mechPropFFF}. An initial number of 20 samples per orientation was produced, however, multiple specimens failed outside the gage section of the coupon and thus, data originating from these samples was considered invalid and was promptly discarded. The valid results are summarized in Table \ref{tab:tensrtab}. Note that $X_t$ was on average 9.16 MPa higher than $Y_t$, a difference of 22.7\%.
\begin{table} [h]

	\caption{Summary of Tensile tests}
\begin{tabular}{ c| c c } 
	\toprule
	\textbf{Information} & $X_t$ & $Y_t$\\
	\midrule
	Average [MPa] & 40.29 & 31.13\\
	Standard Deviation & 0.75 & 0.58\\
	Number of samples & 19 & 12\\
	Lowest measurement [MPa] &39.37  & 29.68\\
	Highest measurement [MPa] &40.90 & 32.08\\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

The behavior of both sets of samples was completely different. Coupons used to measure $X_t$ generally clearly showed whitening of the gage section, indicating plastic deformation. Specimens used for $Y_t$ on the other hand generally failed between beads and rarely showed any change of color. Figure~\ref{fig:tensComp} clearly shows the difference in mechanical behavior. Note how the $X_t$ specimen shows a clearly ductile failure, as opposed to brittle breakage for the $Y_t$ sample.

Statistical analysis reveals that the $X_t$ samples may not necessarily follow a normal distribution. An Anderson-Darling test (ADT) yields a p-value of 0.023, thus, the null hypothesis that the distribution is normalized can be rejected. This can be seen graphically in the goodness of fit plot, where data points fail to properly line up with the straight line that corresponds to a theoretical Gaussian distribution. By contrast, performing the ADT on the $Y_t$ samples fails to reject the null hypothesis. However, the ADT validity has been known to be questionable for sample small sample sizes -such as the 19 replications used in this study.
