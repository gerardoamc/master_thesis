\chapter{Results} \label{ch:res}

This chapter presents all the results originating from the experimental procedures described in Chapter \ref{ch:exp}. Additionally, details are provided regarding data processing, and the calculations that lead to the definition of the desired failure surface. 

\section{Tensile Tests} \label{sec:tensr}
Performing tensile tests showed that the values of $X_t$ and $Y_t$ were significantly different, in accordance to the literature review presented in Section \ref{ssec:mechPropFFF}. An initial number of 20 samples per orientation was produced, however, multiple specimens failed outside the gage section of the coupon and thus, data originating from these coupons was considered invalid and promptly discarded. The valid results are summarized in Table \ref{tab:tensrtab}. Note that $X_t$ was on average 9.16 MPa higher than $Y_t$, a difference of 22.7\%.
\begin{table} [h]

	\caption{Summary of Tensile tests}
\begin{tabular}{ c| c c } 
	\toprule
	\textbf{Information} & $X_t$ & $Y_t$\\
	\midrule
	Average [MPa] & 40.29 & 31.13\\
	Standard Deviation & 0.75 & 0.58\\
	Number of samples & 19 & 12\\

\end{table}

The behavior of both sets of samples was completely different. Coupons used to measure $X_t$ clearly showed whitening of the gage section, indicating plastic deformation. Specimens used for $Y_t$ on the other hand generally failed between beads and rarely showed any change in color. Figure~\ref{fig:tensComp} clearly shows the difference in mechanical behavior. Note how the $X_t$ specimen shows a ductile failure, as opposed to brittle breakage for the $Y_t$ sample. Figure \ref{fig:tensSComp} shows both tested samples side by side.

Anderson-Darling tests (ADT) were performed on the results to validate if the data follows a normalized distribution. In the case of $X_t$, the ADT yields a p-value of 0.023. Thus, on a 95\% confidence interval, a normalized distribution can be discarded. This can be seen graphically in the goodness of fit plot, where data points fail to align with the slope that corresponds to a theoretical Gaussian distribution. By contrast, performing the ADT on the $Y_t$ samples fails to reject a normalized distribution using the same confidence interval, offering a p-value of 0.109. %A case could be made for a false negative for $X_t$ and a false positive for $Y_t$, given the relatively small sample size for each data set.
The results from ADT can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:adttens}.

\section{Compression Tests} \label{sec:compr}
For the compression tests, a total of 25 samples were produced for each orientation. However, a number of coupons were discarded due to manufacturing defects. Table \ref{tab:comprtab} summarizes the test results.  

\begin{table} [h]
	\centering
	\caption{Summary of Compression tests}%ELABORATE
	\begin{tabular}{ c| c c } 
		\toprule
		\textbf{Information} & $X_c$ & $Y_c$\\
		\midrule
		Average [MPa] &43.91  & 57.96\\
		Standard Deviation &3.23  & 1.81\\
		Number of samples &25  & 22\\
		Lowest measurement [MPa] &37.95 &54.93 \\
		Highest measurement [MPa] &48.87 &61.39 \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\label{tab:comprtab}
\end{table}

Surprisingly, both sets of specimens had different failure behavior. The $Y_c$ samples displayed pure ductile behavior through testing. A clear maximum stress can be observed at the yield point in a stress-strain graph, and all samples showed localized whitening and deformation along the center of the specimen. By contrast, the $X_c$ samples showed a considerably lower yield point, cracking sounds were common during testing, and specimens deformed in a way that formed petal-like structures due to contiguous bead delamination. Figure \ref{fig:CompSComp} shows $X_c$ and $Y_c$ samples side by side post testing, where the different failure behavior becomes evident.

\end{figure}

The difference in mechanical behavior can be seen clearly in Figure \ref{fig:comprComp}, where stress-strain curves for $X_c$ and $Y_c$ are compared. Note the erratic behavior of the $X_c$ sample, caused by delamination of adjacent beads.

\end{figure}  

Performing ADT on the data reveals a p-value of 0.072 for $Y_c$, and 0.056 for $X_c$, thus, normalized distributions cannot be discarded on a 95\% confidence interval. These tests can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:adtcomp}. %ELABORATE

\section{Torsion Tests} \label{sec:torsr}
\subsection{45$^\circ$ orientation} \label{ssec:45r}
A total of 30 samples were produced with a 45$^\circ$ bead orientation, divided evenly for tests in positive and negative shear. As was the case for tensile and compressive tests, a number of specimens had to be discarded due to undesired behavior during testing. A common problem was delamination of the grips, thus requiring the data to be discarded. 

Results showed significant difference in behavior depending on the direction of the applied torque. The $S_{45p}$ samples showed a completely brittle behavior, with fracture occurring between beads, as opposed to ductile failure in the center of the specimen for the $S_{45n}$ coupons. This resulted in an average difference of 6.3 MPa between both sets of data. Results are summarized in Table \ref{tab:tors45r} and a graph comparing the behavior of both sets of samples can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:45comp}. Note how the positive shear sample fails at low angles in a completely brittle manner.

\end{figure}
  
\subsection{0$^\circ$ and 90$^\circ$ orientation} \label{ssec:090r}

A total of 10 samples were produced for each orientation. Table \ref{tab:tors090r} summarizes the results from the torsion tests. These were used in conjunction with combined loading data to determine shear and axial stress interactions, as well as the maximum shear strength in the $1-2$ plane.

\section{Combined Loading Tests} \label{sec:clr}

Combined loading scenarios involved testing 10 samples in shear and tension, and 10 in shear and compression, totaling 20 samples for each orientation. These results were plotted in the $\tau_{12}-\sigma_{11}$ and $\tau_{12}-\sigma_{22}$ to develop the terms $\mu_{1112}$ and $\mu_{2212}$ respectively. 
 
\section{Development of the Failure Surface} \label{sec:fsc}

The failure surface calculations were performed using MATLAB\textregistered~code based on previous work by Obst \emph{et al.} \cite{Obst2018} and the mathematical relations shown in Chapter \ref{ch:oocrit}. This code can be found in Appendix \ref{ch:fsurfcode} for reference.

Calculations were based on the average values obtained from the mechanical tests in order to incorporate a probabilistic approach as developed by Zaitsev, Pashkov and Strelyaev \cite{Zaitsev1975}. In practice, this signifies that the condition $f=1$ in Equation \ref{eq:GKCfinal} is equivalent to a probability of part failure equal to 50\%.

Starting with the $\sigma_{11}$-$\sigma_{22}$ plane, it can be seen that the failure envelope has a notable tilt, agreeing with the difference observed between compressive and tensile strengths in both directions, as well as the difference in behavior for the $S_{45}$ tests. Refer to Figure~\ref{fig:1122plane} for a graph showing the calculated failure envelope, including the experimental data for reference.

\end{figure}

It can be seen from the tilt of the envelope that there's a strong interaction between the transverse and longitudinal stresses. Computing all tensorial components associated with the  $\sigma_{11}$-$\sigma_{22}$ plane results in Table \ref{tab:1122calc}. Note how $F_{1122}$ is negative and in the same order of magnitude as $F_{1111}$ and $F_{2222}$. 

\begin{table} [h]
	\centering
	\caption{Tensorial components obtained from tests in the $\sigma_{11}$-$\sigma_{22}$ plane}
	\begin{tabular}{ c c } 
		\toprule
		\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Value} \\
		\midrule
		$F_{11}$ & 1.023$\times 10^{-3}$\\ [1ex]
		$F_{1111}$ & 5.663$\times 10^{-4}$\\ [1ex]
		$F_{22}$ & 7.435$\times 10^{-3}$\\ [1ex]
		$F_{2222}$ & 6.095$\times 10^{-4}$\\ [1ex]
		$F_{1122}$ & -3.139$\times 10^{-4}$\\ [1ex]
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab:1122calc}
\end{table}  

Figure \ref{fig:1122plane} indicates that FFF parts produced with the print parameters used should show considerable strengthening when loaded bi-axially in compression. Further experimental work would be of interest to compare bi-axial compression test data to this result.
