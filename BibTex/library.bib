@inproceedings{Capote2017,
abstract = {The relatively low cost of Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) printers and wide variety of materials -spanning multiple functionalities and prices- make this process interesting for production of functional parts. However, FFF produced objects underperform in terms of mechanical properties when compared to injection molding. Therefore, a study of tensile properties of FFF produced parts was conducted according to the ASTM D-638 standard, using a commercial and an in-house produced ABS filament. Initial tests using commercial ABS revealed poor reproducibility of results, which were analyzed in detail in this study. This led to designing a formal bed levelling procedure for the printer, evaluating effects of printer configuration and material quality as well as exploring modifications to the ASTM test procedure. As a result, test specimens with properties close to injection molding parts were produced. Therefore, the different impact factors will be discussed and the new procedures will be presented.},
