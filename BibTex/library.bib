abstract = {Rapid Prototyping (RP) technologies provide the ability to fabricate initial prototypes from various model materials. Stratasys Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a typical RP process that can fabricate prototypes out of ABS plastic. To predict the mechanical behavior of FDM parts, it is critical to understand the material properties of the raw FDM process material, and the effect that FDM build parameters have on anisotropic material properties. This paper characterizes the properties of ABS parts fabricated by the FDM 1650. Using a Design of Experiment (DOE) approach, the process parameters of FDM, such as raster orientation, air gap, bead width, color, and model temperature were examined. Tensile strengths and compressive strengths of directionally fabricated specimens were measured and compared with injection molded FDM ABS P400 material. For the FDM parts made with a 0.003 inch overlap between roads, the typical tensile strength ranged between 65 and 72 percent of the strength of injection molded ABS P400. The compressive strength ranged from 80 to 90 percent of the injection molded FDM ABS. Several build rules for designing FDM parts were formulated based on experimental results.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study is to utilize fractographic methods employing scanning electron microscope (SEM) images to investigate the effects of build direction and orientation on the mechanical response and failure mechanism for Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene (ABS) specimens fabricated by fused deposited modeling (FDM). The material characterized here is ABS-M30 manufactured by Stratasys, Inc. Measurements of tensile strength, elongation-at-break and tensile modulus measurements along with the failure surfaces were characterized on a range of specimens at different build direction and raster orientation: ??45??, 0??, 0/90??, and 90??. The analysis of mechanical testing of the tensile specimens until failure will contribute to advances in creating stronger and more robust structure for various applications. Parameters, such as build direction and raster orientation, can be interdependent and exhibit varying effects on the properties of the ABS specimens. The ABS-M30 specimens were found to exhibit anisotropy in the mechanical response when exposed to axial tensile loading. The stress-strain data was characterized by a monotonic increase with an abrupt failure signifying brittle fracture. In certain combinations of build direction and raster orientation tensile failure was preceded by slight softening. The tensile strength and modulus, and elongation-at-break were found to be highly dependent upon the raster orientation and build direction. The relationship between the mechanical properties and failure was established by fractographic analysis. The fractographic analysis offers insight and provides valuable experimental data for the purpose of building structures in orientations tailored to their exemplified strength. For instance, specimens loaded such that bonds between adjacent rasters are the primary load bearing mechanism offer the least significant failure resistance. Other examples are shown where artifacts of the FDM fabrication process act to enhance tensile strength when configured properly with respect to the load. The results highlighted in this study are fundamental to the development of optimal design of complex ultra-light structure weight with increased structural efficiency. The study also presents a systematic scheme employing analogs to traditional fiber-reinforced polymer composites for the designation of build orientation and raster orientation parameters.},

@article{Allen2015,
abstract = {Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is an additive manufacturing (AM) method that relies on the thermal extrusion of a thermoplastic feedstock from a mobile deposition head. Conventional FFF constructs components from stacks of individual extruded layers using tool paths with fixed z-values in each individual layer. Consequently, the manufactured components often contain inherent weaknesses in the z-axis due to the relatively weak thermal fusion bonding that occurs between individual layers, as well as poor surface finish in shallow sloped contours. This study demonstrates the use of Curved Layer FFF (CLFFF) tool paths in tandem with a commercially available parallel, or delta, style FFF system to allow the deposition head to follow the topology of the component. By incorporating a delta robot and CLFFF tool paths in this way, improvements in the surface finish of the manufactured parts has been observed, and time costs associated with Cartesian robot based CLFFF manufacturing have been notably reduced. Furthermore, employing a delta robot provides additional flexibility to CLFFF manufacturing and increases the feasibility of its application for advanced manufacturing. The study has also demonstrated a viable approach to multi-material FFF by decoupling support structure and part manufacture into regions of CLFFF and static z tool pathing in an appropriate fashion.},

abstract = {In the quest to achieve functional 3D printed parts with open source machines and tools it is required to study all the error sources. Flow control is a major contributor to accuracy of parts manufactured additively with material extrusion and a precise filament feed rate is therefore essential. Filament slippage is measured in this work. The speed difference between filament feed gear speed and filament speed is measured with a cost effective, automated setup, using a low cost USB microscope video camera and image processing. The filament width is also measured simultaneously, allowing for real time volumetric flow rate estimation. Extrusion temperature and feed rate are found to influence the amount of slippage. Significantly, the amount of slippage varies dynamically and therefore cannot be fully corrected for statically. Proof of concept closed loop control of the extruder is also implemented and reduces the amount of slippage considerably.},

abstract = {Fused deposition modeling (FDM), one of the rapid prototyping techniques is a promising technology for rapid manufacture of end use parts direct from CAD files and with the proliferation of cheaper machines, is likely to play a vital role in future polymer processing, challenging traditional processes such as injection moulding in some cases. Research evidence suggests that the road and layer structures would have significant influences on the mesostructure and consequent mechanical behaviour of the resulting polymer part. While adaptive slicing and other deposition schemes have been attempted for different reasons, it is believed that an appropriate deposition scheme is essential to ensure the best inter-road and interlayer connectivity, resulting in a continuous network of polymer chains, as in the case of the traditional processes. The current research proposes the curved layer deposition for FDM, in particular for thin shell-like parts, to ensure fibre continuity. Mathematical models are developed for curved slicing, implemented in a few case studies, parts are printed, and test results suggest marked improvement in the mechanical characteristics of curved layer parts. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In most fused filament fabrication systems, all filament laydown paths are at constant Z height. This creates a weak direction in the resulting parts, as the interlayer adhesion between melted and solidified material is much weaker than the tensile strength of the bulk material. For example, a hemispherical dome pressure vessel endcap will fail easily along these Z=constant cleavage planes. We resolve this problem by proposing a 3D printing system that does not limit the nozzle positioning to a single Z layer at a time, or to constant pitch and yaw angle, but instead lay down extrusions more closely aligned with the stress tensor within the part (but requiring 5 simultaneous axes of motion). To verify this, we have constructed a working 5-axis fused-filament fabrication 3D printer and produced a number of test parts in ABS, nylon 645, and T-glase polyester. Using a commercial hydrostatic pressure system, we have tested these parts to destruction and find a typical strength improvement of 3x to 5x over conventional 3-axis parts printed to the same specification, in the same machine, from the same spool of polymer; the only thing changed was the extrusion pattern. An approximate calculation to translate this into the material's ultimate tensile strength shows that the 5-axis FFF parts are within a factor of two of the ultimate tensile strength of typical professionally injection-molded ABS material.},

However, there are drawbacks associated with such limited motions, e.g., nonconformal material properties, stair-stepping effect, and limitations on building-around-inserts. Such drawbacks will limit AM to be used in more general applications. To enable 6-axis motions between a tool and a work piece, we investigated a Stewart mechanism and the feasibility of developing a low-cost 3D printer for the multidirectional fused deposition modeling (FDM) process. The technical challenges in developing such an AM system are discussed including the hardware design, motion planning and modeling, platform constraint checking, tool motion simulation, and platform calibration. Several test cases are performed to illustrate the capability of the developed multidirectional AM system. A discussion of future development on multidirectional AM systems is also given},

abstract = {Electrically induced adhesive debonding is a process where an adhesive can be debonded at command with help of an applied voltage. To make this process function, the adhesive is bonded between two metal substrates. In this study an epoxy adhesive is adhered between two aluminium foils forming a laminate structure. The adhesive is made ionically conductive by an addition of an ionic liquid before the curing. This arrangement forms an electrochemical cell, where the metal substrates act as the electrodes while the ionically conductive adhesive acts as the electrolyte. When a voltage is applied over the laminate, a current passes due to electrochemical reactions at the electrode interfaces and ionic transport in the adhesive. This type of material can potentially be used in a wide range of applications. This includes making adhesive joints in automotives to both reduce the total weight but also to simplify the disassembly after end-of-life, enabling an inexpensive recycling process. Another potenital use for debondable adhesives is within consumer packaging. Here it could be possible to pack and transport goods using less packaging material as well as making the handling easier. The aim of this study was to increase the understanding about the processes leading to debonding. This knowledge is important in the development of new types of debonding adhesives. In this study, the commercial laminate Sinuate{\textregistered} was used as a model system. The experiments were focused on the electrochemical behavior and were performed mainly using galvanostatic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Information about the chemistry of debonding was collected with techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mass spectrometry (MS) and Raman spectroscopy. The debonding did always take place at the anodic interface, separating the adhesive and the anode aluminium foil. It was found that the total cell resistance increased drastically during polarization, and that essentially all of this increase originated within the anodic half of the laminate. Examining the resistance behavior with EIS, it was found that the increase in total resistance was reversible. The anodic electrochemical reaction during polarization was determined to consist mainly of an oxidation of aluminium, while the major reaction at the cathodic interface was reduction of water into hydrogen. The debonding process, which took place at the anodic interface, could be related to reaction products formed in the polarization process. These products grew out from the anodic aluminium surface into the adhesive. A debonding mechanism is proposed where these products induce an increase in the adhesive volume, causing stresses at the interface which ultimately result in debonding.},

abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to present the methodology and results of the experimental characterization of three-dimensional (3D) printed ABS and polycarbonate (PC) parts utilizing digital image correlation (DIC). Design/methodology/approach – Tensile and shear characterization of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polycarbonate (PC) 3D-printed parts was performed to determine the extent of anisotropy present in 3D-printed materials. Specimens were printed with varying raster ([+45/-45], [+30/-60], [+15/-75], and [0/90]) and build orientations (flat, on-edge, and up-right) to determine the directional properties of the materials. Dogbone tensile and Isopescu shear specimens were printed and loaded in a universal testing machine utilizing 2D digital image correlation (DIC) to measure strain. The Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, yield strength, ultimate strength, strain at failure, breaking strength, and strain energy density were gathered for each tensile orientation combination. Shear modulus, yield strength, and ultimate strength values were collected for each shear combination. Findings − Results indicated that raster and build orientation had a negligible effect on the Young's modulus or Poisson's ratio in ABS tensile specimens. Shear modulus and shear yield strength varied by up to 33{\%} in ABS specimens signifying that tensile properties are not indicative of shear properties. Raster orientation in the flat build samples reveal anisotropic behavior in PC specimens as the moduli and strengths varied by up to 20{\%}. Similar variations were also observed in shear for PC. Changing the build orientation of PC specimens appeared to reveal a similar magnitude of variation in material properties. Originality/value – This article tests tensile and shear specimens utilizing DIC which has not been employed previously with 3D-printed specimens. The extensive shear testing conducted in this paper has not been previously attempted and the results indicate the need for shear testing in order to fully understand the 3D-printed material behavior.

abstract = {This paper examines the effect of fiber orientation angles and stacking sequence on the torsional stiffness, natural frequency, buckling strength, fatigue life and failure modes of composite tubes. Finite element analysis (FEA) has been used to predict the fatigue life of composite drive shaft (CDS) using linear dynamic analysis for different stacking sequence. Experimental program on scaled woven fabric composite models was carried out to investigate the torsional stiffness. FEA results showed that the natural frequency increases with decreasing fiber orientation angles. The CDS has a reduction equal to 54.3{\%} of its frequency when the orientation angle of carbon fibers at one layer, among other three glass ones, transformed from 0?? to 90??. On the other hand, the critical buckling torque has a peak value at 90?? and lowest at a range of 20-40?? when the angle of one or two layers in a hybrid or all layers in non-hybrid changed similarly. Experimentally, composite tubes of fiber orientation angles of ??45?? experience higher load carrying capacity and higher torsional stiffness. Specimens of carbon/epoxy or glass/epoxy composites with fiber orientation angles of ??45?? show catastrophic failure mode. In a hybrid of both materials, [??45??] configuration influenced the failure mode. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},
