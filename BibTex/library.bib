@article{Berman2012,
abstract = {This article examines the characteristics and applications of 3-D printing and compares it with mass customization and other manufacturing processes. 3-D printing enables small quantities of customized goods to be produced at relatively low costs. While currently used primarily to manufacture prototypes and mockups, a number of promising applications exist in the production of replacement parts, dental crowns, and artificial limbs, as well as in bridge manufacturing. 3-D printing has been compared to such disruptive technologies as digital books and music downloads that enable consumers to order their selections online, allow firms to profitably serve small market segments, and enable companies to operate with little or no unsold finished goods inventory. Some experts have also argued that 3-D printing will significantly reduce the advantages of producing small lot sizes in low-wage countries via reduced need for factory workers. {\textcopyright} 2011 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.},

@article{Baumers2016,
abstract = {As part of the cosmos of digital fabrication technology, Additive Manufacturing (AM) systems are able to manufacture three-dimensional components and products directly from raw material and 3D design data. The layer-by-layer operating process of these systems does not require the use of tools, moulds or dies. Technology observers speculate that AM will have a profound economic impact on the manufacturing sector and indeed on wider society. By constructing a model of production cost for two different AM systems used commercially for the manufacture of end-use metal parts, Electron Beam Melting (EBM) and Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), this paper performs an inter-process comparison of cost performance. High specific costs, measured at {\pounds}2.39 and {\pounds}6.18 per cm3of material deposited respectively, are identified as a central impediment to more widespread technology adoption of such additive systems. The research demonstrates differing levels of system productivity, suggesting that the observed deposition rates are not sufficient for the adoption of EBM and DMLS in high volume manufacturing applications. Despite the absence of amortisable tooling costs, the analysis also reveals that economies of scale are achievable in AM. The results reached are further discussed in the light of the varying strategic requirements posed by the market-pull and technology-push modes of innovation which are both found in the AM industry.},

@article{Koch2017,
abstract = {To aid in the transition of 3D printed parts from prototypes to functional products it is necessary to investigate the mechanical anisotropy induced by the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) process. Since the mechanical properties of an FFF part are most greatly affected by the bead orientation and printed density, or solidity ratio, techniques to precisely control these variables are required. An open source Python program, SciSlice, was developed to create the desired tool paths/layer orientations and convert them into machine commands (e.g. G-Code). SciSlice was then used to develop tool paths which either directly printed tensile specimens or printed sheets from which specimens could be water-jet cut. The effects of proper bed leveling and feed wheel adjustment are noted and a careful analysis of both bead orientation and solidity ratio are presented. Printing artifacts related to turns made at the part edges are discussed having been found to have strong effects on the measure strength in the weakest orientation. Finally, it is shown that with proper bead orientation, low layer heights, and a maximum solidity ratio, tensile strengths within 3{\%} of injection molded parts are achievable.},

abstract = {The relatively low cost of Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) printers and wide variety of materials -spanning multiple functionalities and prices- make this process interesting for production of functional parts. However, FFF produced objects underperform in terms of mechanical properties when compared to injection molding. Therefore, a study of tensile properties of FFF produced parts was conducted according to the ASTM D-638 standard, using a commercial and an in-house produced ABS filament. Initial tests using commercial ABS revealed poor reproducibility of results, which were analyzed in detail in this study. This led to designing a formal bed levelling procedure for the printer, evaluating effects of printer configuration and material quality as well as exploring modifications to the ASTM test procedure. As a result, test specimens with properties close to injection molding parts were produced. Therefore, the different impact factors will be discussed and the new procedures will be presented.},

@article{Rankouhi2016,
abstract = {In contrast to conventional subtractive manufacturing methods which involve removing material to reach the desired shape, additive manufacturing is the technology of making objects directly from a computer-aided design model by adding a layer of material at a time. In this study, a comprehensive effort was undertaken to represent the strength of a 3D printed object as a function of layer thickness by investigating the correlation between the mechanical properties of parts manufactured out of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) using fused deposition modeling and layer thickness and orientation. Furthermore, a case study on a typical support frame is done to generalize the findings of the extensive experimental work done on tensile samples. Finally, fractography was performed on tensile samples via a scanning digital microscope to determine the effects of layer thickness on failure modes. Statistical analyses proved that layer thickness and raster orientation have significant effect on the mechanical properties. Tensile test results showed that samples printed with 0.2 mm layer thickness exhibit higher elastic modulus and ultimate strength compared with 0.4 mm layer thickness. These results have direct influence on decision making and future use of 3D printing and functional load bearing parts.},

abstract = {Given the attention around additive manufacturing (AM), organizations want to know if their products should be fabricated using AM. To facilitate product development decisions, a reference system is shown describing the key attributes of a product from a manufacturability stand-point: complexity, customization, and production volume. Complexity and customization scales enable the grouping of products into regions of the map with common levels of the three attributes. A geometric complexity factor developed for cast parts is modified for a more general application. Parts with varying geometric complexity are then analyzed and mapped into regions of the complexity, customization, and production volume model. A discrete set of customization levels are also introduced. Implications for product development and manufacturing business approaches are discussed.},
