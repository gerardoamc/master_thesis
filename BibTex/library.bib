abstract = {The relatively low cost of Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) printers and wide variety of materials -spanning multiple functionalities and prices- make this process interesting for production of functional parts. However, FFF produced objects underperform in terms of mechanical properties when compared to injection molding. Therefore, a study of tensile properties of FFF produced parts was conducted according to the ASTM D-638 standard, using a commercial and an in-house produced ABS filament. Initial tests using commercial ABS revealed poor reproducibility of results, which were analyzed in detail in this study. This led to designing a formal bed levelling procedure for the printer, evaluating effects of printer configuration and material quality as well as exploring modifications to the ASTM test procedure. As a result, test specimens with properties close to injection molding parts were produced. Therefore, the different impact factors will be discussed and the new procedures will be presented.},

@article{Koch2017,
abstract = {To aid in the transition of 3D printed parts from prototypes to functional products it is necessary to investigate the mechanical anisotropy induced by the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) process. Since the mechanical properties of an FFF part are most greatly affected by the bead orientation and printed density, or solidity ratio, techniques to precisely control these variables are required. An open source Python program, SciSlice, was developed to create the desired tool paths/layer orientations and convert them into machine commands (e.g. G-Code). SciSlice was then used to develop tool paths which either directly printed tensile specimens or printed sheets from which specimens could be water-jet cut. The effects of proper bed leveling and feed wheel adjustment are noted and a careful analysis of both bead orientation and solidity ratio are presented. Printing artifacts related to turns made at the part edges are discussed having been found to have strong effects on the measure strength in the weakest orientation. Finally, it is shown that with proper bead orientation, low layer heights, and a maximum solidity ratio, tensile strengths within 3{\%} of injection molded parts are achievable.},

@article{Rankouhi2016,
abstract = {In contrast to conventional subtractive manufacturing methods which involve removing material to reach the desired shape, additive manufacturing is the technology of making objects directly from a computer-aided design model by adding a layer of material at a time. In this study, a comprehensive effort was undertaken to represent the strength of a 3D printed object as a function of layer thickness by investigating the correlation between the mechanical properties of parts manufactured out of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) using fused deposition modeling and layer thickness and orientation. Furthermore, a case study on a typical support frame is done to generalize the findings of the extensive experimental work done on tensile samples. Finally, fractography was performed on tensile samples via a scanning digital microscope to determine the effects of layer thickness on failure modes. Statistical analyses proved that layer thickness and raster orientation have significant effect on the mechanical properties. Tensile test results showed that samples printed with 0.2 mm layer thickness exhibit higher elastic modulus and ultimate strength compared with 0.4 mm layer thickness. These results have direct influence on decision making and future use of 3D printing and functional load bearing parts.},
