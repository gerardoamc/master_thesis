download Ghostscript: https://www.ghostscript.com/download/

If using Windows:
Note where Ghostscript is installed so you can add its internal folders "bin" and lib" to PATH
(PATH is a system variable. Google Windows x add to path, where x is your current windows version, for how to do this)

open command prompt
cd into the folder containing the file you want to compress
use command: gswin64c -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.5 -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=foo-compressed.pdf foo.pdf
where "foo" is the name of the file you want compressed and "foo-compressed" is the name you want the compressed file to be.
-dPDFSETTINGS= is the compression level, I'd used /prepress in general and then /ebook for smaller options.
